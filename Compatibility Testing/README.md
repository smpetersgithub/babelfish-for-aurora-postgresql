# Babelfish Compatibility Testing

This directory includes scripts designed to evaluate compatibility between Babelfish and SQL Server.  I recommend running these scripts on SQL Server and Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL and creating Compass reports to evaluate compatibility.

üå©Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have included comments concerning any findings related to Babelfish compatibility in the scripts.  I recommend performing a keyword search for "Babelfish" to quickly review any errors, notes, findings, etc., in the provided scripts.

‚ùó&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See **Compass Commands.md** to copy and paste Compass command prompts.

-----------

Here is a listing of files:

*  **Advanced SQL Puzzles Babelfish.sql** - This script contains 70+ puzzles that I have created.  See the [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/smpetersgithub/AdvancedSQLPuzzles/tree/main/Advanced%20SQL%20Puzzles) for more information.  This is a good starting point to test compatibility, as this script contains an assortment of solutions with varying syntax.

*  **Behavior of Nulls Babelfish.sql** - This script was modified from my [Behavior of Nulls](https://github.com/smpetersgithub/AdvancedSQLPuzzles/tree/main/Database%20Articles/Behavior%20Of%20Nulls) documentation that can be used to test Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL behavior of NULL markers.  When reviewing database compatibility, always check for consistency in how NULL markers behave!

*  **Babelfish Bermuda Triangle.sql** - This script contains SQL syntax that is not compatible with Babelfish.  I recommend running this script along with a Compass report and reviewing the output to understand how to best utilize the Compass report.  This file is named after the Bermuda Triangle, a place believed to have supernatural powers where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances, often with their instruments (i.e., compasses) believed not to work.

*  **Deadlock Creation** - This script can be used to check the behavior of deadlocks.
  
*  **Isolation Levels** - This script can be used to check the behavior of the different isolation levels.

#### Below is the output from the Babelfish Berumuda Triangle.sql vs the Compass report.     

Note that this may not be up to date, but provides a quick preview of errors encountered in an SQL script vs what is reported on the Compass report
